## 1. What Is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a sub‑field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to **learn patterns from data** and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each task. At its core, ML relies on **statistical models** that improve automatically when exposed to more data.

| Category | Typical Technique | Example Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Supervised Learning** | Regression, classification (e.g., random forests, deep neural networks) | Image tagging, credit‑risk scoring |
| **Unsupervised Learning** | Clustering, dimensionality reduction (e.g., K‑means, autoencoders) | Market segmentation, anomaly detection |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | Agent‑based learning with rewards (e.g., Q‑learning, policy gradients) | Robotics, game‑playing AI |
| **Generative AI** | Diffusion models, GANs, large language models (LLMs) | Text generation, synthetic media |
