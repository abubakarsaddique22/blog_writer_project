### 1. What Is Data Science?  

Data science is an **interdisciplinary field** that blends computer science, statistics, mathematics, and domain‑specific expertise to extract meaningful insights from large, often complex data sets and turn those insights into actionable decisions.  

- **Core activities** – collecting, cleaning, storing, exploring, modeling, and visualising data.  
- **Goal** – turn raw data into knowledge that solves real‑world problems.

### 3. The Data‑Science Life Cycle  

1. **Problem Definition** – Translate a business or research question into a data‑driven problem.  
2. **Data Acquisition** – Pull data from databases, APIs, sensors, web scrapes, or public datasets. (Harvard’s free courses illustrate hands‑on data collection techniques.)【source】(https://www.msn.com/en-xl/news/other/harvard-university-offers-7-free-data-science-courses/ar-AA1V2ifw)  
3. **Data Cleaning & Pre‑processing** – Handle missing values, outliers, and format conversion.  
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualise distributions, correlations, and spot patterns.  
5. **Modeling** – Apply statistical models, machine‑learning, or deep‑learning algorithms.  
6. **Evaluation & Validation** – Use cross‑validation, A/B testing, or performance metrics (accuracy, RMSE, AUC, etc.).  
7. **Deployment & Monitoring** – Turn models into APIs, dashboards, or embedded services; monitor drift and bias.  
8. **Communication** – Storytelling with visualisations, reports, and stakeholder presentations.
